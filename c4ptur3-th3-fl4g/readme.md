Let's make this a bit trickier...

This was heavily encoded, first I reversed by base64, this returned morse code. After running through a translator I got a strange output, I took the binary section and ran that through a binary to text converter. This output was garbled, but running through a rot47 cipher returned what looked like ascii numbers. Converting these to ascii finally gave the answer.

## Task 2: Spectrograms#

A spectrogram is a visual representation of the spectrum of frequencies of a signal as it varies with time. When applied to an audio signal, spectrograms are sometimes called sonographs, voiceprints, or voicegrams. When the data is represented in a 3D plot they may be called waterfalls.

    1. Download the file

Super Secret Message

When viewing in a spectrogram (I used audacity for this), the message 'super secret message' is spelled out.

## Task 3 Steganography

Steganography is the practice of concealing a file, message, image, or video within another file, message, image, or video.

    1. Decode the image to reveal the answer.

SpaghettiSteg

## Task 4: Security Through Obscurity

Security through obscurity is the reliance in security engineering on the secrecy of the design or implementation as the main method of providing security for a system or component of a system.

    1. Download and get 'inside' the file. What is the first filename & extension?

hackerchat.png

    2. Get inside the archive and inspect the file carefully. Find the hidden text.

AHH_YOU_FOUND_ME!

Unfortunately running strings on the original file immediately provided both of these answers. In reality I imagine you are supposed to use `binwalk -e` for this task.
